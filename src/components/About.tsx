        I&#39;m Krishia — a fullstack developer who talks to APIs more than people.
        I specialize in staring at screens until — voila! — working code appears ✨.
        You’ll usually find me knee-deep in bugs that vanish when someone else looks at them 👻.
        I enjoy building real-time systems, fast games, and solving problems I probably created.
